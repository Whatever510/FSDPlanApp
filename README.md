# FSD Beta App

This app will allow users to create custom routes based on waypoints. The app will send the next destination to the
Tesla navigation. This way the user can focus on the FSD System and does not need to interact with the touchscreen.

The procedure is as follows:

- Survey the local region and mark points of interest (POI).

- Create custom routes with the points and save the routes.

- Select a route and let FSD drive. Once you reach a waypoint, the next destination will be sent to the navigation automatically.


**_NOTE:_** This app is still in development. The sending to the navigation part is not yet implemented. 
Stay tuned for updates!
